# SALES-DATA-VISUALIZATION-USING-SHINY-DASHBOARD

❖ To create a application for Data Visualization.

❖ Using ggplot2 library in R Studio

❖ Automatic Inference for each graph of your data

❖ Ul by using R Shiny

## Dataset
  The datasets are generated through random logic in VBA. These are not real sales data and should not be used for any other purpose other than testing.

   I have been approached for the permission to use data set by individuals / organizations. I just want to clarify one thing. Anything published on this is completely copyright free. You can use anything from this site without any obligation. You can even call the content from this site as your own. Hope, it clarifies. There is absolutely no need to ask for permission for use. 

  You can download sample csv files ranging from 100 records to 5000000 records. 5 Million records will cross 1 million limit of Excel. But 5 Million Records are useful for Power Query / Power Pivot. These csv files contain data in various formats like Text and Numbers which should satisfy your need for testing.

This data set can be categorized under "Sales" category.
